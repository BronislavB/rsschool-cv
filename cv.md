# About Me  

I recently discovered the IT sphere. Having chosen for myself the direction of "Website Development", I am happy to immerse myself every day in the study of the basics and practical exercises in the programs. First of all, I strive to obtain the necessary knowledge to master a new profession.
I love to learn and create something new, and in a difficult situation I try to find a solution to the problem that has arisen.
Undoubtedly, learning a new profession will be a challenge for me, which will show me what I am capable of, but now I am full of determination and this cannot be taken away from me.
